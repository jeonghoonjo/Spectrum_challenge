# spectrum_challenge

I implemented a spectrum detector that can sense Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals when the SNR is less than 0dB. I conducted it with the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) device and controlled it with the USRP Hardware Driver (UHD) Python API. I also applied the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to the spectrum detector and trained the CNN model with the features of OFDM signals.
